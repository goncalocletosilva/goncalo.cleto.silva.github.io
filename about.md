If you want to hire me you should know that I’m obsessed with making playlists and analog photography. I like to think about things, to conceptualize and have ideas, the concept behind what I do is part of my identity as a person and also as a designer.  
            
I’ve studied Communication Design at the Faculty of Fine Arts in Lisbon, where I developed my love for Graphic Design and understood the potencial behind Digital Design. I studied at Politecnico di Milano in Milan-Italy for six months - where I also studied Communication Design and was part of an exhibition event at Base Milano. I ended up at a Post-Graduation course in Digital Experience Design again at the Faculty of Fine Arts in Lisbon what lead my to my current job as a UX Designer @ the Digital Agency Wingman.
                    
I’ve mostly done identities, editorial projects and exhibitions but I’m currently exploring the world of UX/UI Design, and getting more interested in the role of User Experience Design in order to improve the performance of online platforms. 
                
On a regular free day, find me around cheap restaurants and beautiful viewpoints of Lisbon, or drinking at Bairro Alto every once in a while. 
Let's drink a coffee or beer and collaborate on something fun!
