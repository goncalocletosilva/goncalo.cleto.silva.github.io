This project was the redesign of the mobile app "My SNS", the app for the Portuguese National Health Service.
Facing the limitations in terms of features that the current app presented, I challenged myself to rethink it, not only in terms of structure and usability flows as well as in terms of its visual design.
The following app screens intend to show the new interface design for the mobile app, from the homepage, to other important functionalities.
